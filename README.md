This is the codebase that powers [vym.io](https://vym.io), a service that helps
you organize files in pull requests using slide decks.

It uses [Mantra](https://kadirahq.github.io/mantra/), an application architecture
for Meteor.

## Welcome

This repository is rocking Vym. All its pull requests have a slide deck section.

Please go to [pull request  #1](https://github.com/vymio/vym/pull/1) to see an
example. Make sure you have Vym Chrome extension on.


## Security

The keys committed in [settings-local.json]
(https://github.com/vymio/vym/blob/master/settings-local.json) are either dummy
or throwaway keys.

Vym never saves your code anywhere.
