# Vym

This is the codebase that powers [vym.io](https://vym.io), a service that helps
you organize files in pull requests using slide decks.

It uses [Mantra](https://kadirahq.github.io/mantra/), an application architecture
for Meteor.

## Welcome

This repository is rocking Vym. All its pull requests have a slide deck section.

Let's have a look at the slide deck in action. Go to [pull request  #1]
(https://github.com/vymio/vym/pull/1) to see an example. Make sure you have
Vym Chrome extension on.
